# MY RESUME

This is a front-end design of my Curriculum Vitae, It explains my present and future career paths. Presently, I am a software developer, who startd into the industry since 2017 and became actively involved in 2018. Before 2017, I am a certified statistics graduate from Nigeria.

I have several written project unpublished as a data analyst, I owned Research Glitz in 2016, its quite inactive now; but is up on Facebook. The number of information at my disposal triggered my love for data and the techWorld. 


Hence, I' ll rather follow pathways that makes my heart happy.
